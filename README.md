A little fun with Ruby and QT library in gchecker.rb
I know I shouldn't do that, but ... :)

This script is a simple example how you can use Ruby as SEO tool.

Before you are starting use this script, you have to define proxy array in the code.
For example:
proxy = ['1.1.1.1:88','2.2.2.2:5003']

You have to run gchecker.rb in console.

Using example:

ruby gchecker.rb "example keyword" "example.com" "optional language - for example: de"

If you want check for google.co.uk you have to set en_uk:
"example" "example.com" "en_uk"
